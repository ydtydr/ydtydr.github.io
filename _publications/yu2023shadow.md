Hyperbolic space has proven to be well-suited for capturing hierarchical relations in
data, such as trees and directed acyclic graphs. Prior work introduced the concept of
entailment cones, which uses partial orders defined by nested cones in the Poincaré
ball to model hierarchies. Here, we introduce the “shadow cones" framework,
a physics-inspired entailment cone construction. Specifically, we model partial
orders as subset relations between shadows formed by a light source and opaque
objects in hyperbolic space. The shadow cones framework generalizes entailment
cones to a broad class of formulations and hyperbolic space models beyond the
Poincaré ball. This results in clear advantages over existing constructions: for
example, shadow cones possess better optimization properties over constructions
limited to the Poincaré ball. Our experiments on datasets of various sizes and
hierarchical structures show that shadow cones consistently and significantly outperform existing entailment cone constructions. These results indicate that shadow
cones are an effective way to model partial orders in hyperbolic space, offering
physically intuitive and novel insights about the nature of such structures.
